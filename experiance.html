	    <p style="color: black; font-family: century gothic; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">I work as a full-time assistant teacher in a primary school in Shah Alam after completing my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) in 2019. One of my responsibilities is to help a first-year student during school hours. I love kids, so that was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, our country was placed under lockdown during the March 2020 school break because of a high-risk virus and to stop people from leaving their homes. Due to everything moving online, I have only been employed there for about three months.</p>

	    <p style="color: black; font-family: century gothic; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">I worked in Shopee warehouse at Mapletree Logistic as a packer to pack all the orders from customer. It quite tough because we didn't even allowed to sit during working hour. We need to come before 8am and finished work at 7pm.</p>
