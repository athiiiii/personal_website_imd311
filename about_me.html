	    <p style="color: lightpink; font-family: arial; font-size: 25px;"> <b>Goals and Dreams</b></p>
	    <p style="text-align: center; color: white; font-size: 20px; font-family: century gothic; ">At a very early age, my dream was to do something big in life. I want to have a successful career, and for this, I had set an aim. It is quite essential for everybody to get them to establish professionally and successfully. Besides this, few other dreams are also necessary for me like health, relationships, and many different aspects of life. However, I also fear to get fail in achieving all these targets.  This is why I set goals to serve as a roadmap for how I should organize my time and efforts in order to achieve my aspirations. I make two goals which is for my long-term dreams and short-term dreams. In order to assure my financial security, I want to hold a powerful position within an organization. Specific goals before obtaining the position, such as obtaining the best education possible to align my recognition with the job that organization is offering. There is a difference between a dream and a goal. A dream is a gift you want to be given and a goal is something you work to achieve.</p>
